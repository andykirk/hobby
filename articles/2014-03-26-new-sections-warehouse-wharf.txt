I've added two new [board sections](/warhammer-quest-board-sections) a [Warehouse](/warhammer-quest-board-sections#warehouse) and [Wharf](/warhammer-quest-board-sections#wharf) with/without [jetty](/warhammer-quest-board-sections#wharf-and-jetty), with and without a boat.

These sections represent the first in what I hope will be two full (ongoing) board sets - the 'Wooden Floor' set (Warehouse) and the 'City' set (Wharf).
